This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### MVP Requirements:
MVP Features Breakdown:

This app contains one user type.
*Onboarding process for a new user. Include their name, city for their first passport, and email (can include other info you feel is needed).

*Single Passport view: View lists of restaurants in a city they could go to and stamps/punches of restaurants they have been to. (for MVP just scroll down one long page, as a stretch create a book with pages to click and flip through)

*Single restaurant view page:  Within a city passport, allow a user to click in and view restaurant details, mark that they visited the restaurant (which updates the homepage with a stamp or punch), or delete the restaurant from appearing in their passport.

(For the purpose of build week, choose a single city to build a passport for)
*Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.
